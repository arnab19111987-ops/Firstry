          ## Checks
          - [x] Permissions audit (completed)
          - [x] Action SHA pinning (completed)
          - [x] Dependency security (completed)
          - [x] OIDC AWS auth (via remote-cache workflow)
          - [x] CodeQL security analysis (via security workflow)
          
          ## Compliance Status
          - Permissions: Restricted (read-only by default)
          - Actions: SHA pinned (supply-chain secure)
          - Dependencies: Monitored (Dependabot active)
          - Secrets: No static keys (OIDC auth)
          - Cache: Encrypted (AES256)
          
          ## Recommendations
          1. Review CodeQL security findings in Security → Code scanning
          2. Monitor Dependabot PRs for timely updates
          3. Test OIDC role assumption in staging environment
          4. Verify S3 cache encryption in CloudTrail
