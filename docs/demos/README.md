# FirstTry Demos

This folder is for short, real demos we generate from actual runs.

Planned assets:
- `mirror_ci_failed_at.gif` (5s)
  - Recorded from: FIRSTTRY_LICENSE_KEY=TEST-KEY-OK firsttry mirror-ci --run
  - Shows FirstTry stopping at the first failing GitHub Actions step
  - Shows `failed_at` with job / step / stderr / fix hint

We only publish sanitized clips. No proprietary repo names, no secrets.

When ready, add short anonymized GIFs here and reference them from the README.
