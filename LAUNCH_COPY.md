FirstTry is released under the FSAL 1.0 Source Available license.

This lets developers:

- Audit the code

- Trust the behavior

- Submit PRs

- Run it locally

While preventing:

- Rebranding

- Commercial forks

- Competing SaaS versions

This model is the same one used by Elastic, Redis, Hashicorp, Turbo, and Sentry — the best balance between transparency and sustainability for modern developer tools.

Suggested launch text (copy-paste):

"FirstTry is released under the FSAL 1.0 Source Available license.

This lets developers audit the code, run it locally, and submit PRs, while preventing unauthorized commercial forks and hosted SaaS competitors."
