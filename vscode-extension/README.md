# FirstTry VS Code Extension (Preview)

Status: Experimental preview.

What this will do:
- Show FirstTry "doctor" and "gate" results directly in your editor.
- Warn you before you commit code that will fail CI.

What works right now:
- Basic activation and command registration.
- Internal dev tests via `npm test`.

What is NOT ready yet:
- Public marketplace distribution.
- Stable on every workspace.
- Guaranteed compatibility with remote Codespaces.

This extension is *roadmap*, not GA. Early testers only.
